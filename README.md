# YouTubeVideoExtractor

The project is about extracting videos related to a news article from YouTube. The videos can
be directly uploaded by the news publisher or a user sharing the video about that event. It is to
be done for English as well as Indian Language news articles.
<br /><br />
Today many news channels are on YouTube publishing videos every day covering all the
important events of the day. Many times Videos present more interesting information and
highly engaging for news readers rather than an article. So we create a platform where a user
can upload a news article (JSON format), and will receive links and thumbnails of relevant
YouTube videos in a properly ranked order. The news article can be in an Indian language too.
We chose Hindi for this project as it is the most widely used Indian language.
