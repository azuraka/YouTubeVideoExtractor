# YouTubeVideoExtractor
The project is about extracting videos related to a news article from YouTube. The videos can
be directly uploaded by the news publisher or a user sharing the video about that event. It is to
be done for English as well as Indian Language news articles.<br/>
The solution we have come up with is "Data Extraction from News Article -> Queries formation -> YouTube Video Extraction based upon generated queries -> Ranking the extracted videos"
