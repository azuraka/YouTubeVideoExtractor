# YouTubeVideoExtractor
The project is about extracting videos related to a news article from YouTube. The videos can
be directly uploaded by the news publisher or a user sharing the video about that event. It is to
be done for English as well as Indian Language news articles.
The solution we have come up with is "Data Extraction from News Article -> Queries formation -> YouTube Video Extraction based upon generated queries -> Ranking the extracted videos"
